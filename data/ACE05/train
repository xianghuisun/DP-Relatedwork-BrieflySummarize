KUBBA	S-PER

Today	O

there	O

it	O

this	O

But	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O

But	O
we	S-GPE

And	O
,	O
particularly	O

I	S-PER
have	O
in	O

the	B-ORG

KUBBA	S-PER
There	O

we	S-GPE

In	O
the	O

the	O

I	S-PER
guess	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
straight	O
forward	O
when	O
your	S-PER
CEO	O
is	O
also	O
chairman	S-PER
and	O
one	B-PER
of	M-PER
the	M-PER
largest	M-PER
shareholders	E-PER
.	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
tempting	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
my	S-PER
high	O
horse	O
right	O
now	O
about	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
separate	O
the	O
positions	O
of	O
CEO	S-PER
and	O
Chairman	S-PER
but	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
with	O
you	S-PER
I	S-PER
don	O
'	O
t	O
really	O
believe	O
that	O
.	O

I	S-PER
know	O
CEO	S-PER
/	O
chair	S-PER
duality	O
is	O
a	O
popular	O
cause	O
for	O
corporate	O
governance	O
.	O

However	O
there	O
is	O
little	O
empirical	O
evidence	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
separating	O
these	O
roles	O
affects	O
firm	O
performance	O
in	O
either	O
a	O
positive	O
or	O
negative	O
way	O
.	O

Having	O
a	B-PER
combined	M-PER
CEO	M-PER
/	M-PER
Chairman	E-PER
does	O
reduce	O
the	O
ability	O
of	O
the	B-PER
board	E-PER
to	O
act	O
as	O
a	O
check	O
on	O
management	S-PER
and	O
this	O
does	O
mean	O
that	O
you	S-PER
need	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
critical	O
in	O
your	S-PER
assessment	O
of	O
the	O
trustworthiness	O
of	O
the	B-PER
top	M-PER
management	M-PER

.	O

This	O
downside	O
of	O
having	O
a	B-PER
combined	M-PER
CEO	M-PER
/	M-PER
chair	E-PER
is	O
offset	O
by	O
(	O

)	O
a	O
reduction	O
of	O
coordination	O

costs	O
at	O

and	O
(	O

I	S-PER
do	O
however	O
look	O
more	O
carefully	O
at	O
the	B-PER

of	M-PER

CEO	M-ORG+M-PER

Chair	E-ORG+E-PER
before	O
investing	O

It	O
is	O
important	O
that	O
you	S-PER
can	O
get	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
trustworthiness	O
of	O
the	B-PER

Is	O

among	O

Is	O
there	O

of	O

If	O
